# Stackswell - Edited version

- fixed bug that avoided to enter new float values for scales;

- limited breakpoints to 2 mainly used in all web projects

- created by default a small and xsmall style of 12px and 14px for each style

- separate options for rounding of font size and rounding of line height

- added "prefix" option to insert a prefix for the text style (like "Title", "Main" etc)

- added "weight" option to insert a weight for the text style (like "Regular", "Bold" etc)

- now the scale for the small bp is created for second: system is large-first
