# Stackswell - Edited versione

- fixed bug that avoided to enter new float values for scales; limited bp to 2; created by default a small and xsmall style; rounding of font-size is normal for all fonts, rounding for line-height is selectable and by default is set to "muliple of 8"

- added "prefix" option to insert a prefix for the text style

- now the scale for the small bp is created for second: system large first
